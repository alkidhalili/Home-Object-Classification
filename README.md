# Home-Object-Classification



Project Overview
In this homework, I am invited to provide a solution for the classification of images regarding objects in a home environment.
The dataset is composed of 8 categories which are represented as folders with 8694 images in total all together.
In this project I will create a CNN and I will be trying different configurations until I reach an acceptable accuracy and in the end I will try to feed the model with some random images from the web and see if it can predict in the correct form.
